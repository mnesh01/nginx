## Nginx Load Balancer with Node.js Cluster

An Nginx reverse proxy to load balance multiple Node.js instances running in Docker containers. The goal is to efficiently distribute incoming traffic among multiple backend servers to ensure high availability and better performance.

## Technologies used 

Nginx (Reverse Proxy & Load Balancing)
Node.js (Backend Servers)
Docker & Docker Compose (Containerization)
JavaScript

## Setup & Installation

1. Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/mnesh01/nginx.git
cd nginx

3. Build and Run with Docker
docker-compose up --build
This will:
âœ… Start three Node.js instances (on ports 3001, 3002, 3003).
âœ… Start Nginx as a reverse proxy (listening on port 8080).
âœ… Load balance traffic among the running Node.js instances.

4. Access the Application

Once the containers are up, visit:
ðŸ‘‰ http://localhost:80

##Â Configuration Details

Nginx Configuration (nginx.conf):
Uses least_conn strategy to distribute traffic.
Forwards requests to Node.js servers running on 127.0.0.1:3001, 127.0.0.1:3002, 127.0.0.1:3003.
Uses server_name localhost (modify if hosting externally).

Node.js Server (server.js):
Each instance runs a basic Express server on different ports:

Scaling the Application
If you need to scale up, modify docker-compose.yaml by adding more Node.js services and updating nginx.conf.
